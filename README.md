Automating Horizon administration using Python and the Horizon Server API

This repository includes Python scripts that automate Horizon administration tasks using the Horizon Server API.  They're adoptions of sequences originally demonstrated in a public facing Postman collection.  You can view this Postman collection through this link: https://elements.getpostman.com/redirect?entityId=13724510-8bf5937c-0df1-4c4a-b6a6-08ddf2ff372b&entityType=collection 

Each script represents a seperate administrative task originally demonstrated within the Horizon Auomation subfolder of the collection.  These 4 tasks are:

1.)  Assign User To Desktop Pool
2.)  Add VM To Manual Desktop Pool
3.)  Message User And Disconnect 
4.)  Kill Specific App In Session
