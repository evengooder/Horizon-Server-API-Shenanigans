# Horizon-Server-API-Shenanigans

This repository includes Python scripts that automate Horizon administration tasks using the Horizon Server API.  They're adoptions of sequences originally demonstrated in a public facing Postman collection.  You can view this Postman collection through this link: https://elements.getpostman.com/redirect?entityId=13724510-8bf5937c-0df1-4c4a-b6a6-08ddf2ff372b&entityType=collection.  For additional details on how this Postman Collection is configured check out my blog post at https://www.evengooder.com/2024/09/chaining-horizon-server-api-calls.html

Each script in this respository represents a seperate administrative task originally demonstrated within the Horizon Auomation subfolder of the Postman collection referenced above.  These 4 tasks are:<br/>

1.)  Assign User To Desktop Pool<br/> 
2.)  Add VM To Manual Desktop Pool <br/>
3.)  Message User And Disconnect <br/>
4.)  Kill Specific App In Session <br/>
